# QuickDoodle
Quick Doodle is a simple and straightforward drawing app for iOS, built with Swift and UIKit. Not a lot of settings or brushes to fiddle with and get caught up in. Simply select from a handful of colors and start doodling. Brush size and opacity are available in Settings, as well as RGB (red, green, blue) sliders to create custom colors. Artwork can be shared via Twitter and/or Facebook, or saved to your device.
